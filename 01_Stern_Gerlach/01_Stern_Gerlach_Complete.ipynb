    "The McIntyre text discusses a modification of the experiment presented above in which $\\hat{S}^{x}$ is still <i>analyzed</i>, but the beams are not split. This is subtly different from what occurs in the last exercises in which we obtained measurement information but did not <i>store</i> it. As we'll see, forcing the quantum state into a well-defined value of (say) $\\hat{S}^{x}$ is what has such spooky consequences for the notion of the operator $\\hat{S}^{z}$ having a \"well-defined\" value.\n",
    "\n",
    "What we would like to do in this last exploration is to analyze $\\hat{S}^{x}$ after peeling off the subset of unpolarized spins with $S^{z} = \\frac{1}{2}$ without actually measuring $\\hat{S}^{x}$. To accomplish this, we will modify the <b>measure_op()</b> so that while it does split the state <b>v</b> into a linear superposition of $\\left|+\\right\\rangle_{x}$ and $\\left|-\\right\\rangle_{x}$, it does not <i>project</i> the state onto one of these eigenstates through a measurement that returns either $S^{x} = \\frac{1}{2}$ or $S^{x} = -\\frac{1}{2}$.\n",
